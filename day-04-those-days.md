# Those Days

This'll sound trite, I know, but you're going to have those days. Those days
when you're moody. When you can't stop beating yourself up. Those days when you
feel like you'll never get to the places you want to reach. When you feel like
you've wasted so much time that can never be recovered. You're overwhelmed by
your environment and frustrated with your situation. You feel like no one
cares. You just want to curl up and hide from the world.

You felt fine yesterday, so why today do you feel this way, for no reason?
There is a reason, though: the world is not an easy place to exist. It's out of
your control and highly variable, and sometimes those variables are not going
to be set in your favor. That's okay. You're not broken. You're just human. To
be human is to suffer, sometimes one day at a time.

Peace is fleeting. "Being happy" means working at it every single day, and even
then, some days aren't going to work out. Allow the suffering: it's part of our
human condition, so you may as well practice. Resistance only buries emotions
and makes them uglier next time they burrow back to the surface. Let them wash
over you. Be sad. Be frustrated. Cry. Reflect. The only way out in this
existence, is through.

Then, go to bed early. You probably need the sleep, anyway. You get to try
again tomorrow. Write a new story. It'll be better.

# Broken Lines

The smooth, continuous lines of your life are an illusion. A dream we've woven
between the distinct moments that are strung together through the march of
time. But each moment is a world unto itself.

Most of the time the illusion is undetectable, and that's a good thing. We
don't want to be conscious of every moment and the myriad possibilities it
holds. We create consistency through repetition, raising the probability that
we can know what to expect next, painting the lines we imagine from moment to
moment. We need those expectations. They're what allow us to move through our
lives without being overwhelmed constantly.

Probability is not a guarantee, though. Sometimes, the gap between those
moments is revealed. Sometimes it's dramatic. Sometimes we only notice in
retrospect. But the world you've known is bisected, into before and after.
You're still you, but your world has fragmented and your perspective has
shifted permanently. This has happened to all of us. Those spaces stick around,
rippling into our futures like a pebble in a pond, and shaping our expectations
for the moments that come after, shaping who we will be.

If you were only ever to follow a smooth line through your life, there wouldn't
be very much to define you. Those broken lines may break us, and often we'll
wish the illusion could have been maintained. But we patch ourselves together
the best we can, connect the dots, and keep going, riding the waves as they
come at us. Because forward is the only way, and there's so much more ahead.

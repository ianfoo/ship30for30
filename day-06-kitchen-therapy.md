# Kitchen Therapy

You know those things in your life that you'd just rather not deal with? You
know, those tasks that aren't necessarily that difficult, but that you find
yourself avoiding? If you don't know what I mean, then, hey, congratulations:
you're doing a really good job. For the rest of us, though, let me tell you
something: I don't really care what you're not doing. I care what you *are*
doing, instead.

Me? I spend way too much time lolligagging in the kitchen. I'm not a fancy
cook, and definitely not a fast one, but it doesn't matter. Time in the kitchen
is quiet therapy. When you work a lot with a computer, in a made up world,
making something with your hands is especially rewarding. The virtual world is
limitless, but lacks tactile satisfaction. There's catharsis in gathering
ingredients; working them with the knife; saut√©eing vegetables. Can you smell
the tomato sauce cooking down on the stovetop? Can you see the golden brownness
of the fresh biscuits? Cooking demands intention, and intention slows my mind
down from the world's hectic pace; quieting the din I usually have to try to
make sense of. That sort of meditation is invaluable. 

There are so many things we feel like we *should* do, but the things we
*actually do* reveal who we really are. Indulging your fancy is kind of what
makes us whole. It's kind of beautiful, the way we take care of ourselves
quietly, in the ways we need to. Do the things you need to do. The rest will
wait.

# Tell Me About Your Marathon

I started running again recently. I used to run. I ran a marathon, I like to
tell people. It was a long time ago, but it's one of those things that's under
your belt forever once you've done it. It's a part of you, and no one can take
that away from you.

Sometimes people are surprised that I did this, because I don't "look" like a
runner. There's a reason for this, though, because I am not "a runner." I'm
just someone who goes from point A, to point A, in a circuitous manner at an
elevated pace. I started doing it because it was becoming clear to me that I
needed to do more than, y'know, nothing, and the barrier to entry is really
low. Just move your feet faster than you normally would. Poof, you're a runner
now.

The marathon was a long time ago. I don't mention it to be obnoxious, but
sometimes a conversation comes close enough that I can say something without
feeling braggy. It's not bragging, though. The things that make you interesting
are the parts of you that you don't share with most others. And it's okay to be
proud of your accomplishments, especially the ones that you really worked for;
the ones you put your whole self into. There are enough phony accomplishments
that people wave around out there. You'd better make an effort to wave around
your real ones.

Tell people about your marathons. You're special, and you earned it.

# Many Hands

I didn't see it coming tonight. Nothing was planned, and nothing went according
to plans. But I was part of a healing ceremony. Not like what you're
imagining--stop that--but I think everyone there got healed, at least a little,
anyway. I can't say exactly how, if you were to ask me what I meant, but if
you'd have been there, you'd have known. You'd have felt it. You'd have
accepted its gentle invitation, flowing like the edges of a warm ocean over
your feet, slowly being buried in the sand as the waves lap, lap, lap.

We laughed. We bantered and barbed as a close group can, sanctuary that it
provides. GIFs were exchanged. Lots of emoji. Drinks were drunk. We played our
instruments, as badly as we each thought, or as well as anyone else watching
thought we might have.

We did this all silently, though, through a computer screen. Not a peep from
any of us and not a touch between us. Just words and intention and sentiment,
tapped, typed, or otherwise expressed; smiles, glances--maybe a furrowed brow
or two.

It didn't matter why you were there. It only mattered that you were, and that
you left smiling.

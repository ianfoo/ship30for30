# The Two Sides of Now

He stood on the precipice, staring into the murky darkness, contemplating its 
vastness. It was a place he'd wanted to reachâ€”a long time ago, in factâ€”yet here
he was, feeling paralyzed by the possibility of it all. The possibility and the
uncertainty were a metaphor for everything, everywhere, of course: the blurry
lines of the universe conform to any vague form provided, after all. But he had
to stop himself from whirling out of control and keep the everythingness from
taking over his mind and grinding it to a halt, as it had for so long up until
this point.

There are two sides to every moment: regret and anxiety. Regret, looking
backward and lamenting lost opportunity; a culmination of inactionâ€”usuallyâ€”and
the passage of time, our most precious resource, by far. Anxiety, looking
forward and being fearful of the unknown amongst all the variables swirling
around our existence, conscious of how unlikely *anything* is, given the
billions of possibilities, and left unchecked as the moment passes, the makings
of future regret.

Regret and anxiety steal the only thing we really have, and the only thing that
really matters: this very moment. The only thing that we know is real, and the
only thing we can control. These dual villains are insidious, though, and creep
in quietly in the absence of eternal vigilance. The only way to beat them is
to open your heart and submerge yourself fully.

He grit his teeth, and dove in. ðŸŒŠ

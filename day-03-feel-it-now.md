# Feel It Now

Aside from love, music has been the most powerful influence in my life. It
touches my soul, and I depend on it. Through it, I have found all manner of
insight and inspiration. I've made the closest of friends, traveled to places
far away, and felt energy swirling between audience and performer. It's popular
to compare it to a religion, which I can understand, and as far as I can tell,
music hasn't started nearly as many wars, so it seems like as good a thing to
put your faith into as anything.

Leading up to the Big Silence, I'd found myself a little crankier at shows than
I had been in the past, as venues seemed more packed, and crowds seemed
chattier and chattier. I mean, that was all probably me, though, growing more
acutely aware and frustrated with elements that had always been there. But no
matter. I long for the day—soon, I hope—when I can squeeze through a sweaty
throng of humanity in a packed house; when someone accidentally spills beer on
my shirt; when I can move my body to the thundering drums and throbbing bass,
feeling the tension build. I close my eyes and wait, digging deeper,
anticipating. *And then it happens.* I toss my head back and throw my hands
into the air as the release crashes upon us. We are all together, far from
shore and the rest our lives, in this perfect moment.
